# BattleStation 2017

> An Electron and Vue.js project

## Installing

### Installing Node:
- For Linux: [Install Via Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- For Windows: [Use Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Building
The BattleStation needs to be compiled before it can be used.

```bash
# watches for fileupdates and triggers rebuild (for dev work)
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
Either commands can be run. `npm run dev` will be handy for development, as it will continually watch for file updates and rebuild the app.

## Running
`npm start` runs the Electron app. From there nothing else needs to be done.
